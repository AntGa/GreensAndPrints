# Greens & Prints

Greens & Prints is a headless e-commerce application created in 2024, focused on selling a wide variety of plants. Built using the Next.js framework, the application aims to provide a smooth, fast, and intuitive user experience while offering dynamic product displays and responsive design. This project also allowed me to deepen my knowledge of modern web technologies such as TypeScript, React, TailwindCSS, and GraphQL, all while maintaining high-performance standards and seamless interactions for end-users.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
